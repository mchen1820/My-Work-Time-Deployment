# My Work Time

The AI tool for generating summaries, transcriptions, and code

## Overview

My Work Time is a Flask-based web application that leverages Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Computer Vision models to help users quickly extract insights from a variety of content formats. It can:
- Summarize PDF documents, videos and audios
- Summarize your code
- Transcribe audio and video
- Generate quiz questions based on the input (PDF document, video, audio)
- Extract text from images
- Generate code from prompts
- Translate code from one language to another

## Installation

To install My Work Time, fork the Github Repo and use an IDE of choice to open the applications (Visual Studio Code is the preferred IDE). 

Then, obtain a Google API key. Follow [these](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) instructions to obtain a key. Remember to save your API key in a secure location. Make sure you follow the instructions to set your API key as an environment variable. Alternatively, go to the app.py file and replace line 12 with "client = genai.Client(api_key="[YOUR-KEY-HERE]")"

For video/audio files to properly be uploaded to the website you need to download FFMPEG. Here are the [instructions](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).

Finally, run the app.py file to launch the website. Use the website link in your IDE’s terminal to launch the website in your web browser. You are all set to use the website!
